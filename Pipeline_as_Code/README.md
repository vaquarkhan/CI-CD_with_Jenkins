Jenkins Pipeline provides an extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex delivery pipelines "as code". The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is typically written into a text file (called a Jenkinsfile) which in turn is checked into a projectâ€™s source control repository.

* Version control
* Best Practices
