We need to understand continuous integration before we start playing with Jenkins.
Integration is the development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day each check and then verified by an automated build teams to detect problems early.
A continuous integration system usually involves a tool that keeps monitoring the version control system. Whenever a change to version control system is detected ,the system would automatically build and test your application. If a built or test is not green, the system immediately notifies the developers to fix the issue right away.

### Why do we need Continuous Integration?
  - Detect problems or bugs, as early as possible, in the
development life cycle.
  - Since the entire code base is integrated, built and tested
constantly , the potential bugs and errors are caught earlier in
the life cycle which results in better quality software.
